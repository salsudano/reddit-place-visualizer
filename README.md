# reddit-place-visualizer

A C++ GUI application that lets you visualize r/place evolve over time. It loads the diffs.zip file into memory (which just contains 1 snapshot of the r/place in 5 second intervals), then lets you view the image at any point in time that's capured within diffs.zip.

It's a windows only application. 

More details about the r/place archive diff file can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/6396u5/rplace_archive_update/
